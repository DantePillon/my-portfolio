      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>This is where you'll find lots of information about... well me, Dante.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I am driven and motivated to improve my skills and develop efficiently and to a high standard of quality. 
        I have self learned many technical skills including: 
        <ul>
          <li>languages: Javascript/HTML/CSS, Java, SQL;</li>
          <li>tools: Node.js, Git, Express.js, LaTeX;</li>
          <li>Dynamics 365/Power Platform.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="POO">
        I also have deep interest mathematics and science, I have completed several courses through online content published by American universities. 
        My knowledge includes: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calculus 1-3 (covering limits and differentiation, integration and series, multivariable and vector analysis);</li>
        <li>Linear Algebra;</li>
        <li>Ordinary Differential Equations.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
      I plan to continue my studies and learn more about the topics I find fascinating. I would love to work in a field where I can apply mathematics using my IT skills one day, however jobs which require a deep knowledge of higher level mathematics are fairly scarce; still I keep my aspirations regardless.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>I have self learned several creative softwares for my own enjoyment including Blender (3D modelling software), Reaper (digital audio workstation), and Musescore (music notation/composition software). I enjoy messing around with these softwares in my spare time.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I really love sport; there are many sports I would like to do for a couple years, and there are sports I have been doing for a little while. I tend to prefer solo sports over team sports since you tend to get more action.
        Some of my favourite sports include: Martial Arts, Squash, and Mountain Biking. I would really like to try some sports consistently like Rock Climbing and Volleyball.
        I think the thing I love about sports is the excitement and thrill, when you're tumbling down a mountain bike trail, not really in control, it is a great feeling (that is, if you manage to not die by the end of it), but in another way,
        when you know exactly what you are doing and are fully confident in your abilities to pull off some kind of a jump. 
        I still think the most enjoyable part of learning a sport is the space between when you can barely do anything right, and when you start approaching mastery, it an get a bit mundane or even frustrating past that point.

        I also really enjoy the piano

      <h2>Games</h2>
      <p>
        Ahhh... I love games! When I've finished a hard days work, I like to sit back, crack open a cold one, and play some of the video games I've made as a way to relax and enjoy myself.

      <h2>So Why Should You Hire Me?</h2>
      <p>
        Are you kidding me? Do I even need to justify myself? Just imagine if your website was exactly like this one, how amazing would that be?
        You can even steal my amazing games for your customers to play while browsing your website (I still haven't gotten around to securing
        them as intellectual property yet).
